    <h2>Intro</h2>

    <p>The Slick Akka Http is a very simple json rest api showing one way of using akka http with slick 3 library for database access.
    </p>

    <p> It supports the following features:    </p>

    <ul><li>   Generic Data Access layer, create a DAL with crud for an entity with just one line    </li>
        <li>   Models as case classes and slick models, independent from database driver and profile    </li>
        <li>   Multiple database types configured in properties file (h2 and postgresql for instance)    </li>
        <li>   Cake pattern for DI    </li>
        <li>   Spray-json to parse json    </li>
        <li>   Cake pattern for DI    </li>
        <li>   Tests for DALs    </li>
        <li>   Tests for routes   </li></ul>
    <p>   Utils:    Typesafe config for property management  and Typesafe Scala Logging (LazyLogging)    </p>

    <h2>Running</h2>

    <p>
        The project was thought to be used as a seed for creating akka-http projects with slick, so the implementation is minimal. The model is very simple, is a supplier with a name and description.
</p>  <p>
    The rest api has a get and a post (json), a get for get all the suppliers, and a post to add suppliers. You should view this info in swagger with more detail.
</p>  <p>
    For running the project go to section run, and run it.
</p>  <p>
    For running the project in sbt:

    <pre><code>
    $ sbt
    > run
    </code>
    </pre>


</pre>
</div>



<div>
    <h2>Slick 3</h2>
    <p>Models as case classes and slick 3 schemas extending from a BaseEntity and BaseTable </p>

    <pre><code> case class Supplier(name: String,desc: String)  extends BaseEntity </code></pre>


    <pre><code>class SuppliersTable(tag: Tag) extends BaseTable[Supplier](tag, "SUPPLIERS") {
  def name = column[String]("userID")
  def desc = column[String]("last_name")
  def * = (id, name, desc) <> (Supplier.tupled, Supplier.unapply)
}</code></pre>


    <p>BaseEntity and BaseTable provide Id for the class and table.</p>

    
    <p>The model definition is database independent. The database type is declared in application.conf, for each database. For instance, we use an h2 database in this example with the follow configuration:</p>
    <pre><code>
        h2db {
          driver = "slick.driver.H2Driver$"
          db {
            url = "jdbc:h2:mem:test1"
            driver = org.h2.Driver
            keepAliveConnection = true
            numThreads = 10
          }
        }
    </code></pre>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Cake Pattern</h2>
    <p>This seed uses cake pattern to add the possibility to use alternative implementations of some modules, for instance, in tests, the seed uses an alternative implementation for persistence.
    <p>The seed are organized in modules: ActorModule, ConfigurationModule and PersistenceModule. When we are implementing a class/actor that uses some of this dependencies, we just mix them with the modules, or put a parameter that receives the injected modules, for instance:</p>

    <pre><code>
        class RoutesActor(modules: Configuration with PersistenceModule)
    </code></pre>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>Generic DAL</h2>
    <p>This seed has a generic slick dal that can be used to implement a crud for an entity.</p>
    <p>The generic DAL is used in suppliers DAL as example:</p>

    <pre><code>
        	override val suppliersDal = new BaseDalImpl[SuppliersTable,Supplier](TableQuery[SuppliersTable]) {}
    </code></pre>
